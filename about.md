### Work

I touch computers for a living. These days I'm living in Amsterdam and writing software at [summitto](https://summitto.com) to help fight VAT fraud.

Previously I have worked at:
* [bol.com](https://www.bol.com/) as a Systems Engineer maintaining and improving the storage and backup infrastructure.
* [VCU](https://www.vcu.edu) as the Technical Lead on a team of Systems Engineers running the university's ERP infrastructure.
* [STR Software](https://www.strsoftware.com) as a Software Engineer developing document delivery and mobile work order solutions.


### Else

When I'm not touching computers I enjoy [biking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAAkaIsF_Ko/), [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/p/CGwmpCfFaDo/), [whitewater sports](https://www.instagram.com/p/BghseaCjq5L/), and [other](https://www.instagram.com/p/B19TCXglrdx/) [outdoor](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlkzQo5n783/) [adventures](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByRNf2LFCLv/).
